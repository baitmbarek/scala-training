/**
  * Solve the following statement by defining all the necessary functions and structures.
  * You'll have to define tests for your code, and use the example data above.
  *
  * Statement :
  * Albert is a german football supporter, wishing to attend to his favorite team's away game.
  * He's living in Düsseldorf and wants to travel to Lyon by train.
  * Since there are multiple possibilities with correspondences with specific conviniences, help Albert to :
  * 1) Find all possible paths he can use
  * 2) Rank the paths by cost (the cheaper the better)
  * 3) Attend his game starting at 9pm for the lowest cost. Albert has a meeting by the morning and can't leave Düsseldorf before 1pm
  *
  * We suppose trains are leaving every minute (which is absurd but limits complexity)
  *
  * Data for testing, extracted from fictive railway companies :
  *
  * Departure   Arrival    Time    Cost (euros)
  * Düsseldorf  Stuttgart  3h05     5
  * Düsseldorf  Paris      3h48    323
  * Düsseldorf  Cologne     27min   15
  * Stuttgart   Zurich      2h54    16
  * Stuttgart   Strasbourg  1h20    20
  * Strasbourg  Paris       1h45    15
  * Cologne     Luxembourg  3h40   19
  * Cologne     Bruxelles   1h50    21
  * Bruxelles   Paris      1h20     29
  * Bruxelles   Luxembourg  2h55      45
  * Zurich      Geneve    2h40    30
