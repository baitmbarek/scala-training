  * Exercise 2 : Estimate Pi
  *
  * The Monte Carlo method is based on the following rule :
  *     Lets say we have a square with
  *       x € [-1 ; 1] ; y € [-1; 1]
  *     We draw a circle, centered at (0,0) with radius = 1
  *     We randomly put points in the square.
  *     On a large number of iterations, consider the estimation of Pi as the result of the following equation :
  *     4 * number of hits in the circle / total number of drops
